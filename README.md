# Job_Recomender_System
The proposed system recommends the top-n jobs to the job seekers by analyzing and
measuring similarity between the user skills and explicit features of job listing using
content-based filtering. First-hand information have been gathered by scraping jobs
features from major cities in Saudi Arabia (Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam). Top skills
required in job offers have been analyzed and job made job recommendations by matching
skills from resumes to posted jobs. To quantify recommendation success and error rates,
we have sought to compare the results of our system to reality using decision support
measures.
